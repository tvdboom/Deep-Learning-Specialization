## Deep Learning Specialization

Assignments for the coursera Deep Learning specialization given by Andrew Ng and provided by deeplearning.ai. Assignments were made in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

The specialization includes 5 courses:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects --> Does not include assignments
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models

The courses teach the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. Topics include Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. All assignments are case studies about healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. The specialization also includes TensorFlow and Keras tutorial and practices.
